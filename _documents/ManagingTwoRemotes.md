# Reference for Two Remotes

Since this project is using both an assignment remote repo, as well as a personal one for further profile development work, I will be pasting commands here that I am still getting used to here:

```
git remote -v
```

```
git push origin main
git push secondary main
```

```
git fetch origin
git fetch secondary
```

```
git push --all secondary --force
```
